Excellent. This is a solid first pass at the refactoring task, and it's great that you're looking for critical feedback to improve it further. The changes are largely correct but can be refined for robustness, clarity, and to avoid some potential pitfalls.

Here's a critical review of the provided `diff`.

### **High-Level Assessment**

The core logic is mostly right:
1.  The `evm_version` is correctly added to `ChainConfig` and the `arb_sepolia.yaml`.
2.  The `# pragma evm-version` lines have been correctly removed from the contracts.
3.  The logic in `update_contract_deployment` to get `evm_version` from `chain_settings` instead of parsing the file is correct.

However, the implementation of how `compiler_args` are passed to `boa` is not present in the diff, and the introduction of `set_chain_settings` suggests a global state/monkey-patching approach that can be improved.

### **Critique 1: The `set_chain_settings` Approach (The Biggest Issue)**

The introduction of `set_chain_settings` and `boa_patch` is a significant architectural choice that has drawbacks.

```python
# scripts/deploy/__init__.py
from .deployment_utils import ..., set_chain_settings 

# ...
# Initialize chain settings for compiler args (must be done before any contract loading)
set_chain_settings(chain_settings)
```

**Problems with this approach:**

1.  **Implicit Dependency & Global State:** It introduces a global state. Any function that calls `boa.load_partial` now *implicitly* depends on `set_chain_settings` having been called first. This makes the code harder to reason about and test in isolation. If someone forgets to call it or calls it at the wrong time, they will get confusing errors. The comment `# must be done before any contract loading` is a clear sign of this "spooky action at a distance."
2.  **Less Maintainable:** What happens when we need another compiler argument, like `{"experimental_codegen": True}`? We'd have to modify the patch again. It's better to make the dependency explicit.
3.  **Monkey-Patching Obscures Logic:** While authorized, monkey-patching should be a last resort. It makes it difficult for a new developer (or your future self) to understand where the `compiler_args` are coming from just by looking at a `boa.load_partial()` call. They would have to know about the patch.

**A Better Approach: Explicitly Passing `compiler_args`**

The original plan to explicitly pass `compiler_args` to every `boa.load_partial` and `boa.load` call is more robust and self-documenting. It's more typing, but it's much clearer.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Remove `boa_patch.py` and the `set_chain_settings` function.**
2.  Revert the change in `scripts/deploy/__init__.py` that calls `set_chain_settings`.
3.  Go back to the original plan: In `deploy_contract` (and all other places contracts are loaded), create the `compiler_args` dictionary and pass it directly.

```python
# In scripts/deploy/deployment_utils.py -> deploy_contract

# ...
compiler_args = {"evm_version": chain_settings.evm_version}
deployed_contract = boa.load_partial(contract_to_deploy, compiler_args=compiler_args).deploy(*args)
# ... etc for all load calls
```

This makes the data flow explicit and avoids the pitfalls of global state.

### **Critique 2: Missing `compiler_args` in `boa.load_partial` Calls**

The `diff` for `scripts/deploy/deployment_utils.py` updates the call to `update_contract_deployment` but **does not show the changes to `boa.load_partial`**. This is the most critical part of the refactor. Without it, the compiler will default to its standard EVM version, and the change will have no effect.

**Recommendation:**

Ensure that **every single call** to `boa.load`, `boa.load_partial`, and `boa.deploy_as_blueprint` throughout the entire codebase includes the `compiler_args` parameter. This is tedious but necessary.

Files to double-check:
-   `scripts/deploy/deployment_utils.py` (the main one)
-   `scripts/deploy/test_pools/deploy_tokens.py`
-   `scripts/deploy/test_pools/deploy_pool.py`
-   `scripts/tests/post_deploy/utils.py` (`get_contract` function)
-   All files in `tutorial/`
